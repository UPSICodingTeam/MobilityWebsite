# MobilityWebsite

![screenshot]

This is a static version of the UPSI Mobility Website. These files were developed first, before being converted into a more dynamic `Wordpress` template. This version of the project is open to be used/experimented, to be a quick reference, or as an example to any projects that might benefit from it. This project uses several frameworks to support the development of the static version:
* `Foundation Sites 6` for the UI framework
* `Vanilla Javascript` for interactive support


This project has been developed by Dr Hafiz Hanif @ UPSI, Malaysia.
